# labelNoise_test_set

This classification test set hase been developed to promote testing machine
learning models against several classes of label noise. A clean label set is
provided along with six labelings that have been altered to exhibit 3 
types of label noise at two noise levels.

##Data Collection
Raw data was gathered from the IMU of a commercial smart phone that is being
carried by either a human or canine walking over level ground at a steady
pace. The phone is carried top-up and screen-out on the right side of the 
walker. Raw data was collected in 10 to 15 minute segments. The test canine
was a 1 year old corgi named Roux.

##Data Processing
The first 30 seconds of the raw files were discarded to remove artifacts from
starting the tracking app and placing the recorded on the walker.
